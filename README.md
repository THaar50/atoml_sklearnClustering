# Automated Testing Of Machine Learning (atoml)

atoml is a software for generating smoke and metamorphic tests for machine learning software that is currently under development. The aim of atoml is to make machine learning software more robust, i.e., ensure correct working, even if the data is extreme. 

Because this is an early research prototype, the code is partially very unrefined, e.g., the configuration of the MySQL database we use is hardcoded. 

# Usage

atoml is a command line tool that can be used with the following options. 

```
-f,--file <arg>         input file in yaml format (mandatory)
-i,--iterations <arg>   number of iterations used by smoke tester
                        (default: 1)
-m,--features <arg>     number of features for each generated test set
                        (default: 10)
-mysql                  the results are stored in a local MySQL database
                        if this flag is used
-n,--instances <arg>    number of instances generated for each test set
                        (default: 100)
-t,--timeout <arg>      timeout parameter for the created tests in seconds
                        (default: 21600)
-nomorph                no metamorphic tests are generated if this flag
                        is used
-nosmoke                no smoke tests are generated if this flag is used
```

A call to atoml may look like this:

```
java -jar atoml.jar -f testdata/descriptions.yml
```

# Supported Machine Learning Frameworks

Atoml can generate tests for Weka, Scikit-Learn, and Apache Spark MLlib. Other frameworks may follow (see Experimental Features). Atoml currently works with all classification and clustering algorithms defined by those frameworks.

# Definition of Tests

Atoml automatically generates tests from a description of the algorithm. Algorithms are described by the machine learning framework, the package and class in which they are implemented, the features they support (e.g., double, float, categorical), a set of properties that they should fulfill, and the definition of their hyperparameters. The supported features and the properties are used to decided which test cases are generated for the algorithm, i.e., which input data is suitable, which smoke tests can be executed, and which metamorphic relations should be fulfilled. The hyperparameters are used to derive tests for different combinations of hyperparameters. A grid search of the hyperparameters is due to the exponential nature of the number of allowed combinations not possible. Currently, atoml uses the default value for all except one parameter. For the remaining parameters, different values are tested. 

All the above information is defined in a YAML file. The [descriptions.yml](testdata/description.yml) file contains examples for classifier definitions as well as a description of the YAML dialect. Here is an example for the definition of tests for the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn. 

```yaml
name: SKLEARN_DecisionTreeClassifier
framework: sklearn
type: classification
package:  sklearn.tree
class: DecisionTreeClassifier

  same: score_exact
  scramble: score_exact

    type: values
    values: [gini, entropy]
    default: gini
  splitter:

    default: best
  min_samples_split:

    default: 1
  min_weight_fraction_leaf:
    type: double
    min: 0.0
    max: 0.5
    stepsize: 0.25
    default: 0.0
  max_features:
    type: values
    values: [auto, sqrt, log2, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, None]
    default: None
  max_leaf_nodes:
    type: integer
    min: 10
    max: 20
    stepsize: 5
    default: None
  min_impurity_decrease:

    max: 0.4
    stepsize: 0.2
    default: 0.0
  class_weight:

    values: [balanced, None]
    default: None
  ccp_alpha:

    stepsize: 0.2

# Running tests generated with atoml

Atoml generates the tests such that they can be executed with the test runner that is already available for the programming languange in which the tests are defined, i.e., JUnit for Weka and Spark MLlib, and the built-in Python unittest for sklearn. 

# Using the MySQL/Maria Database and the Dashboard

Atoml also provides the option to store results in a MySQL/Maria database. In this mode, the assertions of the test runners are replaced with code that stores the results in the MySQL database. The [create_mysql_schema.sql](scripts/create_mysql_schema.sql) contains the code to generate the schema for the database (notice that atoml currently requires a predefined user to write test results into the database). There is also a simple [dashboard](dashboard/main.py) that can be used to visualize the results. We recommend the creation of a virtual environment for the dashboard as follows.

```
cd dashboard
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

The dashboard can then be started.

```
source bin/activate
python main.py
```

In case of SQL errors regarding Public Key Retrieval it might be required to add the client option "allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true" to the mysql-connector to allow the client to automatically request the public key from the server (do not use this, if the database is not a local database, since it can be used for a Man-In-The-Middle-Attack).

# Experimental Features

Caret support: The test generation for the R-based Caret framework is currently only available for the generation of smoke tests for classification algorithms.

Predictions output: By adding the flag '-predictions' to the function call, the generated smoke tests save the predictions on the test data, and separately the predictions on the training data itself, in two csv files. This is currently only available for classification algorithms from caret, sklearn, spark, and weka.   

AIToolBox support: Test generation for classification and clustering algorithms supported on Linux is available. '-mysql' option is currently not supported.
